IMPORTANT: do not forget

== VIM user manual (as it comes with :h users-manual)

=== About the manuals -- user_01.txt

Reviewing the tutor every once in a while might be a good idea.

Two manuals: (i) A User manual, with task oriented explanations, (ii) A reference manual

===== Jumping around

 :bp  /  :bn   (or CTRL-O / CTRL-I when just changed buffers)  to go to the previous / next buffer

 <TABS> or Ctrl-I goes to next jump, Ctrl-O    both could be in a different buffer

 :ju(mps)  will display a jump list, can be navigated with the mouse in codevim
    :<n>Ctrl-O / <n>Ctrl-I jumps <n> times in VIM
    :cle(arjumps)

==== Run commands

 :e $MYVIMRC to edit the correct vimrc file.

In Linux Mint,  ~/.vim/vimrc contains one line:    'source ~/Documents/GitHub/cheat-sheet_VIM/vimrc'

 :scriptnames  " to see what files & plugins are loaded at startup

 :new
 :put=execute('scriptnames')  " will write the list in a new file

VSCode will check in Settings (Ctrl+comma)  Vim> Vimrc:Path for vimrc file


=== The first steps in Vim -- usr_02.txt

==== Getting out

Normal mode: ZZ is equivalent to :wq   when in help, windows ZZ also closes help without exiting the program.

WARNING: If not in the help window, if all buffers are saved, vim will quit

==== Finding help

 :h  display help main file, shows a list of modes and their command prefixes (prepend).
  commonly used ones are:
        Normal mode: no prefix
        Visual mode: enter with v, V, or Ctrl-v, prefix: v_    ex.: v_U capitalize, v_u lowercase, v_~ switch
        Insert mode: enter with a,A, i,I o or O, prefix: i_    ex.: :h i_CTRL-[ i_<Esc>
        Options, prefix:'     ex.: :h 'ai   shows set autoindent help
        Regex, prefix: /    :h /$   shows <EOL> help
        Command-line editing: : prepend help with c_
                 :help c_command_name  " how to edit in the lower-screen command line
                 :help c_<Del>
        Command argument: prepend help with -
                 :help -command_name
                 :help -r    " list swap files that can be recovered

TIP: :vert h toc     is often a good way to start help in a 'landscape' screen

 :helpgrep <subject>
 :cwindow  " to browse results
 :cnext / cprev " to jump to next / previous result

command line completion with <TAB> is especially useful for :help

 :set nu rnu    is useful while reading help or manual

 :h help-summary     is useful

Key combinations.  They usually start with a single letter indicating the mode for which they can be used.
    e.g.:    :help i_CTRL-X
  takes you to the family of CTRL-X commands for insert mode which can be used to auto-complete different things.  Note, that certain keys will always be written the same, e.g. Control will always be CTRL or ctrl.

 For normal mode commands there is no prefix and the topic is available at
    :h CTRL-<Letter>    E.g.  > :help CTRL-W    shows the list of windows sizing & control commands

  In contrast >
    :help c_CTRL-R      will describe what the CTRL-R does when entering content of registers in commands in the Command line

    :help v_CTRL-A      talks about incrementing numbers in visual mode

    :help g_CTRL-A      talks about the "g<C-A>" command (e.g. you have to press "g" then
 <CTRL-A>).  Here the "g" stands for the normal command "g" which always expects a second key before doing something similar to the commands starting with "z".


=== Moving around -- usr_03.txt

==== Search

Searching for text \< and \> are special markers that match beginning and end of a word.

 /\<word\>   search for the whole word only

 :set hls  highlights searched char string, :noh temporarilly removes highlight

 :set ic  highlights incremental search

 :set list / :set nolist turns invisible characters on / off

==== Marks
 
 ma to make a mark,
 'a ('<SPACE>a with US-int'l keyboard) to move so that cursor is as col.1 of this mark's line.
 `a to place cursor right on the mark.

 :marks    List all the current marks

 :marks {arg} List marks mentionned in {arg}.  For example :marks a8

:delm[arks] {marks}   Delete the specified marks.  For examples :delm ab c    deletes marks a, b, and c

Special marks include:

        '       The cursor position before doing a jump
        "       The cursor position when last editing the file
        [       Start of the last change
        ]       End of the last change

=== Making small changes -- usr_04.txt

        x  stands for  dl  (delete character under the cursor)
        X  stands for  dh  (delete character left of the cursor)
        D  stands for  d$  (delete to end of the line)
        C  stands for  c$  (change to end of the line)
        s  stands for  cl  (change one character)
        S  stands for  cc  (change a whole line)


 d`m  deletes between current position and mark m

 di' / da' deletes inside / around a '' quoted string
 di" / da" deletes inside / around a "" quoted string
 di` / da` deletes inside / around a `` quoted string

The operators, movement commands and text objects give you the possibility to
make lots of combinations.  Now that you know how they work, you can use N
operators with M movement commands to make N * M commands!

For example, there are many other ways to delete pieces of text.  Here are a
few common ones:

 x       delete character under the cursor (short for "dl")
 X       delete character before the cursor (short for "dh")
 D       delete from cursor to end of line (short for "d$")
 dw      delete from cursor to next start of word
 db      delete from cursor to previous start of word
 diw     delete word under the cursor (excluding white space)
 daw     delete word under the cursor (including white space)
 dG      delete until the end of the file
 dgg     delete until the start of the file
 
 Operators:
 If you use "c" instead of "d" they become change commands.
 With "y" you yank the text.
 ~       swap case (only if 'tildeop' is set), ex: ~[Space with US Int'l keyboard]w   swap word's case
 g~      swap case
 gu      make lowercase
 gU      make uppercase
 g?      ROT13 encoding
 >       shift right
 <       shift left
 gq      text formatting
 gw      text formatting with no cursor movement
 =       filter through 'equalprg' or C-indenting if empty






 v motion :w FILENAME   saves the Visually selected lines in file FILENAME 

After listing buffers with  :ls  close buffer n   with :bdn

 :reg(isters)    or    :di(splay)  shows registers


                                                linewise characterwise
The operator either affects whole lines, or the characters between the start and end position.

 ["x]dd                  Delete [count] lines [into register x] linewise.


 ["x]D                  Delete the characters under the cursor until the end
                        of the line and [count]-1 more lines [into register
                        x]; synonym for "d$".

 ["x]c{motion}          Delete {motion} text [into register x] and start insert.  

 ["x]cc                 Delete [count] lines [into register x] and start insert.
                        If 'autoindent' is on (:set ai), preserve the indent of the first line.


 ["x]C                  Delete from the cursor position to the end of the
                        line and [count]-1 more lines [into register x], and
                        start insert.  Synonym for c$.


 ["x]s                  Delete [count] characters [into register x]
                        and start insert (s stands for Substitute).
                        Synonym for "cl".


 ["x]S                  Delete [count] lines [into register x] and start insert.
                        Synonym for "cc".


 In replace mode -- started with R --, Ctrl-y will copy chars from precedent line, <BS> or Ctrl-h will undo the replace, putting back chars from initial text.


 :h CTRL-W to list windows controls, including:
  ctrl-+ / ctrl - & ctrl > / ctrl <    to increase / decrase window's height / width

 Ctrl-^ or Ctrl-6 switches between % (current) and # (alternate) files.

=== Both VIM and mscodevim

 Moving forward / backward just before a char 'c' on a line: tc / Tc
 ';' ',' repeats in the same / opposite direction

 "for a long text between parentheses", from anywhere in the middle, T" Ctrl-v ,    or    t" Ctrl-v ,    will select the inside of ""
 A better way:  Ctrl-v-i "  will do the same.   Ctrl-v a "  will select the "" as well.
 
 Normal mode: db & dB, when cursor is as beginning of a word, will delete the precedent word along with the space in between.

 Whith cursor on a specific line, scrolling file so that line shows 1rst on top is best done with zt
 Alternatively zz to have file scroll so that line shows in the middle, zb to have it at bottom
 H M L position the cursor on screen without scrolling the file.
 Alternatively :set nu rnu    and then n CTRL-E[nd] / n CTRL-Y[esterday] will scroll the file by n lines down / up

 */ # will match whole word the cursor is on forward / backward
 g* / g# will also match words containing the word the cursor is on, g.e.: when on 'the', g* will match then there, therefore and so on.

 X stands for dh (delete character left of the cursor)

 In visual mode, having started in the middle of what should be selected, 'o' brings back the cursor to the other end of the selection for further selection.
 'O' moves to the other corner of the same line.

 ~ is an operator if :set top  or  :set tildeop is set in VIM, then works as such for text-objects in codevim.
 ~ inverse upper & lower case

 u to undo one change, U to undo all the changes on a line

 n next occurence same direction, N next occurence opposite direction, repeat N to keep in this opposite direction

 r replaces one character, R replaces until <ESC> (Replace mode)

 i_CTRL-T / i_CTRL-D adds / deletes  one shiftwidth of indent in the current line

 'current selection' -- "* reg --, and 'real clipboard' -- "+ reg -- in X-Windows:
-  Select two words in Visual mode.
-  Use the Edit/Copy menu to get these words onto the clipboard.
-  Select one other word in Visual mode.
-  Use the Edit/Paste menu item.  What will happen is that the single selected
   word is replaced with the two words from the clipboard.
-  Move the mouse pointer somewhere else and click the middle button.  You
   will see that the word you just overwrote with the clipboard is inserted
   here.
