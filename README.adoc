IMPORTANT: do not forget

== VIM user manual (as it comes with :h users-manual)

=== About the manuals -- user_01.txt

Reviewing the tutor every once in a while might be a good idea.

Two manuals: (i) A User manual, with task oriented explanations, (ii) A reference manual

===== Jumping around

 :bp  /  :bn   (or CTRL-O / CTRL-I when just changed buffers)  to go to the previous / next buffer

 <TABS> or Ctrl-I goes to next jump, Ctrl-O    both could be in a different buffer

 :ju(mps)  will display a jump list, can be navigated with the mouse in codevim
    :<n>Ctrl-O / <n>Ctrl-I jumps <n> times in VIM
    :cle(arjumps)

==== Run commands

 :e $MYVIMRC to edit the correct vimrc file.

in Linux Mint,  ~/.vim/vimrc contains one line:    source ~/Documents/GitHub/cheat-sheet_VIM/vimrc 

 :scriptnames  " to see what files & plugins are loaded at startup

 :new
 :put=execute('scriptnames')  " will write in the new file

VSCode will check in Settings (Ctrl+comma)  Vim> Vimrc:Path for vimrc file


=== The first steps in Vim -- usr_02.txt

==== Getting out

Normal mode: ZZ is equivalent to :wq   when in help, windows ZZ also closes help without exiting the program.
! If not in the help window, if all buffers are saved, vim will quit !

==== Finding help

 :h  display help main file, shows a list of modes and their command prefixes (prepend).
  commonly used ones are:
        Normal mode: no prefix
        Visual mode: enter with v, V, or Ctrl-v, prefix: v_    ex.: v_U capitalize, v_u lowercase, v_~ switch
        Insert mode: enter with a,A, i,I o or O, prefix: i_
        Options, prefix:'     ex.: :h 'ai   shows set autoindent help
        Regex, prefix: /    :h /$   shows <EOL> help
        Command-line editing: : prepend help with c_
                 :help c_command_name  " how to edit in the lower-screen command line
                 :help c_<Del>
        Command argument: prepend help with -
                 :help -command_name
                 :help -r

 :helpgrep <subject>
 :cwindow  " to browse results
 :cnext / cprev to jump to next / previous result

command line completion with <TAB> is especially useful for :help

While reading help or manual :set nu rnu    is useful

 :h help-summary     is useful

Key combinations.  They usually start with a single letter indicating the mode for which they can be used.
    e.g.:    :help i_CTRL-X
  takes you to the family of CTRL-X commands for insert mode which can be used to auto-complete different things.  Note, that certain keys will always be written the same, e.g. Control will always be CTRL.

 For normal mode commands there is no prefix and the topic is available at
 :h CTRL-<Letter>. E.g.  >
    :help CTRL-W
  In contrast >
    :help c_CTRL-R
  will describe what the CTRL-R does when entering commands in the Command line and >
    :help v_CTRL-A
  talks about incrementing numbers in visual mode and >
    :help g_CTRL-A
  talks about the "g<C-A>" command (e.g. you have to press "g" then
 <CTRL-A>).  Here the "g" stands for the normal command "g" which always expects a second key before doing something similar to the commands starting with "z".


:h help-summary 11)

=== VIM only


 v motion :w FILENAME   saves the Visually selected lines in file FILENAME 

 :set hls  highlights searched char string, :noh temporarilly removes highlight

 :set ic  highlights incremental search

 :set list / :set nolist turns invisible characters on / off

 Searching for text \< and \> are special markers that match beginning and end of a word

 After listing buffers with  :ls  close buffer n   with :bdn

 :reg(isters)    or    :di(splay)  shows registers


						linewise characterwise
The operator either affects whole lines, or the characters between the start and end position.

 ["x]dd                  Delete [count] lines [into register x] linewise.


 ["x]D                  Delete the characters under the cursor until the end
                        of the line and [count]-1 more lines [into register
                        x]; synonym for "d$".

 ["x]c{motion}          Delete {motion} text [into register x] and start insert.  

 ["x]cc                 Delete [count] lines [into register x] and start insert.
                        If 'autoindent' is on (:set ai), preserve the indent of the first line.


 ["x]C                  Delete from the cursor position to the end of the
                        line and [count]-1 more lines [into register x], and
                        start insert.  Synonym for c$.


 ["x]s                  Delete [count] characters [into register x]
                        and start insert (s stands for Substitute).
                        Synonym for "cl".


 ["x]S                  Delete [count] lines [into register x] and start insert.
                        Synonym for "cc".


 In replace mode -- started with R --, Ctrl-y will copy chars from precedent line, <BS> or Ctrl-h will undo the replace, putting back chars from initial text.


 :h CTRL-W to list windows controls, including:
  ctrl-+ / ctrl - & ctrl > / ctrl <    to increase / decrase window's height / width

 Ctrl-^ or Ctrl-6 switches between % (current) and # (alternate) files.

=== Both VIM and mscodevim

 Moving forward / backward just before a char 'c' on a line: tc / Tc
 ';' ',' repeats in the same / opposite direction

 "for a long text between parentheses", from anywhere in the middle, T" Ctrl-v ,    or    t" Ctrl-v ,    will select the inside of ""
 A better way:  Ctrl-v-i "  will do the same.   Ctrl-v a "  will select the "" as well.
 
 Normal mode: db & dB, when cursor is as beginning of a word, will delete the precedent word along with the space in between.

 Whith cursor on a specific line, scrolling file so that line shows 1rst on top is best done with zt
 Alternatively zz to have file scroll so that line shows in the middle, zb to have it at bottom
 H M L position the cursor on screen without scrolling the file.
 Alternatively :set nu rnu    and then n CTRL-E[nd] / n CTRL-Y[esterday] will scroll the file by n lines down / up

 */ # will match whole word the cursor is on forward / backward
 g* / g# will also match words containing the word the cursor is on, g.e.: when on 'the', g* will match then there, therefore and so on.
 
 ma to make a mark, 'a ('<SPACE>a with US-int'l keyboard) to move so that cursor is as col.1 of this mark's line.  `a to place cursor right on the mark.

 X stands for dh (delete character left of the cursor)

 In visual mode, having started in the middle of what should be selected, 'o' brings back the cursor to the other end of the selection for further selection.
 'O' moves to the other corner of the same line.

 ~ is an operator if :set top  or  :set tildeop is set in VIM, then works as such for text-objects in codevim.
 ~ inverse upper & lower case

 u to undo one change, U to undo all the changes on a line

 n next occurence same direction, N next occurence opposite direction, repeat N to keep in this opposite direction

 r replaces one character, R replaces until <ESC> (Replace mode)

 i_CTRL-T / i_CTRL-D adds / deletes  one shiftwidth of indent in the current line

 'current selection' -- "* reg --, and 'real clipboard' -- "+ reg -- in X-Windows:
-  Select two words in Visual mode.
-  Use the Edit/Copy menu to get these words onto the clipboard.
-  Select one other word in Visual mode.
-  Use the Edit/Paste menu item.  What will happen is that the single selected
   word is replaced with the two words from the clipboard.
-  Move the mouse pointer somewhere else and click the middle button.  You
   will see that the word you just overwrote with the clipboard is inserted
   here.


== Lists

look at various.txt line 580 for list of commands to use

=== :jumps


=== :marks


== From Quick Reference: see quickref.txt  :help quickref


=== matchit-configure

Configuration is local to the buffer (buffers could be of different languages, so different matching pairs).  So use :let instead of :set

== Get specific help


=== Normal mode command

== VIM

== Todo

check: https://github.com/yulonghu/vim-sensible

In what situations use:
CTRL-T : jump to [count] older entry in the tag stack (default 1).
